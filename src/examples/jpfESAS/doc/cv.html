<h1>Environment Assumptions</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>reduce "false positives" and trivial errors by introducing constraints
  on valid (realistic) event sequences (= environment constraints)</li>
  <li>automatically generate constraints that can serve as "flight rules"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>given an alphabet of relevant events, use compositional verification
  techniques to generate constraint candidates (by running JPF as an oracle)</li>
  <li>encode validated constraints as automata that are executed
  synchronuously with the UML state machine, cutting off invalid event
  sequences before they could lead to property violations</li>
</ul>
