<h1>Why Executable Models?</h1>

<h2>(1) if you have complex systems to develop &rArr; <em>use models</em></h2>
<ul>
  <li>to focus on isolated aspects of system</li>
  <li>in the beginning, mostly to facilitate understanding and communication<br>
      (esp. to derive requirements and procedures)</li>
  <li>deliberately vague in the beginning, becomes harder to read
  as model gets refined and formalized</li>
</ul>
<p class="comment"><a href="model.html">ESAS 1.5EOR/LOR diagram, aspect annotated (model) diagram</a>, 
<a href="uml.html">UML formalization</a> &rarr; does it work?</p>

<h2>(2) if you have complex models &rArr; <em>make them executable</em></h2>
<ul>
  <li>as models get more complex, it becomes harder to validate them
      (see what model does)</li>
  <li>validation greatly improved by simulation &rArr; model execution
      (turn model into program)</li>
</ul>
<p class="comment">nominal sim, tli-sim (error by chance, show in
model diagram,UML) &rarr; shows how much people implicitly "assume" in informal
models</p>

<h2>(3) if you have executable models &rArr; <em>verify them</em></h2>
<ul>
  <li>simple fact: programs show defects - model or implementation ??</li>
  <li>find as many model defects as possible before system development starts</li>
  <li>models less complex than real system, implementation has less
      constraints &rArr; use tools to automate verification (faster, less expensive)</li>
</ul>
<p class="comment">tli (systematic error detection), but more errors ?
&rarr; JPF scriptless (show lasJettison, stage1Abort ambiguity)<br>
too many "impossible" defects &rarr; assumption based model checking</p>
